1. Conduct your own research in order to estimate the number of passengers for years 2015-2018. You must also provide data for the two segments: Domestic and International flights.
2. Comment briefly on the historical (given) data and the estimated volumes figures, explaining your findings and what implications they may have on the US Airline industry. What do you expect may happen to the US Airlines volume in 2016? 
3. Please calculate growth rates and CAGR for 2014 - 2018 for the total volume figures and save the result in cell O25. Please present the total volume of the US Airlines industry over the years 2010-2018 on a graph generated using Excel.
												
##Â Part B													
4. Please calculate annual average number of passengers in every country over the 2010-2019 time period. (please save the formulas and results in column O)
5. What was the percentage difference between the passenger volumes in France and Canada in 2015?
6. Based on the country statistics listed in Table 1, briefly comment in writing on the combined European airline market's volume in the years 2010-2015.

The results should be presented in a short presentation (up to 10 minutes long). All sources used should be named and saved, methodology of the research explained and all calculation presented. 
The presentation can be in any format of your choice. How you generated your answers is important so please leave any formulas used in the calculation of your results on the sheet. Should you not have access to excel then it will be available at the day of interview. 
The airlines industry comprises passenger air transportation, including both scheduled and chartered, but excludes air freight transport. Industry volumes are defined as the total number of revenue passengers enplaned (departures) at all airports within the country or region, excluding transit passengers who arrive and depart on the same flight code. For the US and Canada, transborder passengers departing from either country are considered as part of the international segment. This avoids the double-counting of passengers.
